          <h1 id="pre-shared-key-transport-protocol-psk">Pre-Shared Key Transport Protocol (PSK)</h1>
<p class="intro">The Pre-Shared Key (PSK) protocol is an end-to-end transport protocol, used by the sender and receiver of an ILP payment to decide on a condition and fulfillment for a payment. By default, the protocol also encrypts any additional data sent along with the payment, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">AES-256-GCM</a>. The full ILP payment is authenticated through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">HMAC-SHA-256</a> which is used to generate the fulfillment of a PSK payment. The entirety of the PSK data, including public headers, encrypted private headers, and encrypted private data, is encoded into an octet-stream that forms the data portion of the <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0003-interledger-protocol/0003-interledger-protocol.md">ILP Packet</a>. The PSK data is authenticated via AES-256-GCM in addition to the HMAC-SHA-256 which authenticates the full ILP payment.</p>
<p>Pseudocode for this protocol can be read <a href="#pseudocode">at the bottom of this spec</a>.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, PSK relies on a pre-shared secret key. In application-layer protocols like <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol.md">SPSP</a>, the receiver generates the shared key and shares it with the sender over an end-to-end secure communication channel such as HTTPS. Alternatively, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a> could be used directly to generate the shared secret key.</p>
<p>An advantage of PSK is that the pre-shared secret key only needs to be shared once. As long as both parties possess this key and are listening for transfers, they can send payments between one another.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of PSK is that it is repudiable. Although the sender does get cryptographic proof that the recipient received the payment, that proof cannot be used to convince 3rd parties that the sender did indeed send the funds, because the sender could have generated the fulfillment themselves. However, simple proof for the sender that the recipient got the funds is sufficient in many applications. The <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0011-interledger-payment-request/0011-interledger-payment-request.md">Interledger Payment Request</a> transport protocol should be used instead in cases where non-repudiable proof is required.</p>
<h2 id="flow">Flow</h2>
<ol>
<li>The pre-shared secret key is shared out of band.</li>
<li>The sender creates a 16-byte (128-bit) nonce with cryptographically-secure randomness.</li>
<li>The sender constructs the PSK data:<ol>
<li>The sender starts with the PSK status line: <code>PSK/1.0\n</code></li>
<li>The sender appends the <a href="#public-headers">public headers</a> (including the nonce), followed by <code>\n\n</code>.</li>
<li>If the public <code>Encryption</code> header starts with <code>aes-256-gcm</code>, then the remainder of the PSK data after the public headers (padded with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography">PKCS</a>#PKCS7)) will be encrypted using AES-256-GCM with the pre-shared secret key, using the nonce as the initialization vector. The 16-byte AES-256-GCM authentication tag is attached to the <code>Encryption</code> header, encoded in base64url. Note: The ciphertext is raw binary data, and is not base64 encoded. If the public <code>Encryption</code> header is set to <code>none</code>, then the remainder of the PSK data will be appended in unaltered cleartext.</li>
<li>The sender appends the <a href="#private-headers">private headers</a>, followed by <code>\n\n</code>.</li>
<li>The sender appends the application data (in its raw binary format).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The sender creates the condition of their payment by taking the HMAC of the full ILP packet with the pre-shared secret key, and computing the SHA-256 hash of it.</li>
<li>The sender quotes and sends their payment, setting the data field of the ILP packet to the PSK data.</li>
<li>The receiver gets notified by their ledger of an incoming prepared transfer with an ILP packet.</li>
<li>If the public <code>Encryption</code> header is set, then the receiver derives the payment encryption key from the pre-shared secret key, sets the AES-256-GCM initialization vector to the <code>Nonce</code> header in the PSK public headers, and uses them to decrypt the private headers and their data. The AES-256-GCM authentication tag is attached to the <code>Encryption</code> header. If the public <code>Encryption</code> header is set to <code>none</code>, the receiver parses the private headers and their data in clear-text.</li>
<li>The receiver verifies that the amount in the incoming transfer matches the amount in the ILP packet. The receiver may also call an external system to make sure the incoming funds are expected.</li>
<li>The receiver fulfills the incoming transfer with the HMAC of the ILP packet, using the same HMAC key as the sender, derived from the shared secret.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-format">Data Format</h2>
<p>The PSK details are divided into two sets of headers. Each set of headers is formatted like those found in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2">HTTP Requests</a>. Application data is appended to the private headers, after a blank line. This object is then encrypted and appended to the public headers as binary data, after a blank line. Both private and public headers are parsed in the exact same way as HTTP headers. All strings are UTF-8 encoded.</p>
<h3 id="nonce">Nonce</h3>
<p>Every PSK payment must generate a random 16-byte (128-bit) nonce. A cryptographically secure source of randomness <strong>MUST</strong> be used.</p>
<p>The nonce is included in the PSK data, which is then put into the ILP packet and hashed to generate the payment&apos;s fulfillment. Because each PSK payment&apos;s fulfillment is an HMAC of its ILP packet and the shared secret, repeating the same ILP packet without a different nonce would yield a payment with the same fulfillment. A malicious connector could save up the fulfillments of PSK payments and then submit them whenever a packet is repeated exactly.</p>
<p>The nonce is also used to set the initialization vector of AES, ensuring that the same data will encrypt to different ciphertext across different payments. This is important to prevent connectors from figuring out the cleartext of the application data. If the nonce is repeated, then any payments containing that repeated nonce can be decrypted.</p>
<h3 id="public-headers">Public Headers</h3>
<p>The public headers and their data are formatted as below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-http">PSK/1.0
Nonce: fpwpAhlN588
Key: hmac-sha-256
Encryption: aes-256-gcm 58EowcXBk3qBIvJ0kmvdCh
Header: data_everyone_can_see

...
</code></pre>
<p>The public headers come after a single status line, which must be <code>PSK/1.0</code>. Public headers are visible to all parties transmitting the packet, so they SHOULD contain only the bare minimum required for the intended parties to decrypt and validate the private headers.</p>
<p>PSK payments use an HMAC of the PSK details as a fulfillment, to prove that the contents are unmodified. The pre-shared secret key is the key used in the HMAC.</p>
<p>The data attached to these headers is an encrypted binary blob. This encrypted blob contains the private PSK headers.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that connectors can read the public headers&apos; data, connectors should not be required to do so, nor should they rely on PSK details being present on all transfers. This information is only intended for the initial sender and final receiver of a payment.</p>
<p>The decryption key is derived from the pre-shared secret key, and the AES-256-GCM initialization vector is set to the value of the <code>Nonce</code> header (<code>fpwpAhlN588</code> in the above example). The nonce MUST be generated with cryptographically-secure randomness. <strong>If the nonce is reused with the same shared secret, it could leak unencrypted data or allow money to be stolen by malicious parties.</strong> The 16-byte AES-256-GCM authentication tag used for decryption is attached to the <code>Encryption</code> header, encoded in base64url (<code>58EowcXBk3qBIvJ0kmvdCh</code> in the above example). The encryption MUST use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography">PKCS</a>#PKCS7) for padding.</p>
