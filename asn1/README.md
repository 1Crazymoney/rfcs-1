# Interledger ASN.1
> Collection of ASN.1 modules corresponding to Interledger standards

## Introduction

Interledger standards are defined using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) as defined in ITU X.680 and encoded with Octet Encoding Rules (OER) as defined in ITU X.696. By relying on ASN.1 we can take advantage of highly sophisticated tooling which allows us to verify the integrity of our specifications and the correctness of our implementations. By encoding with OER we ensure that parsers are very simple to write, wire formats are compact and encoding/decoding performance is excellent.

## Specifications

These formats are based on Interledger specifications, which are available as [IL-RFCs](..).
