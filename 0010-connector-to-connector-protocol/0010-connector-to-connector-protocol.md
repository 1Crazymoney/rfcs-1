# Connector to Connector protocol

## Discovery

Connectors discover their peers through out-of-band communication, or by looking at https://connector.land and contacting the administrator of another connector.

Once peered, two connectors have a ledger between them; this is often a ledger with just two accounts, often administered collaboratively by the two connectors.

## Route broadcasts

Connectors send each other `broadcast_routes` messages, using the message sending functionality of the ledger between them.

The syntax of such a method is defined by https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-connector/blob/v17.0.2/schemas/RoutingUpdate.json and
 https://github.com/interledgerjs/five-bells-shared/blob/v22.0.1/schemas/Routes.json.

When a route is included in a route update from Alice to Bob, Alice is stating she will, at least temporarily, be able to forward a payment to that destination, if the
source amount which Bob would send her is high enough, given the destination amount, and as described by the `points` piece-wise linear function.

Connectors also exchange quote requests,
in the same way users may request a quote from a connector, see [IL-RFC 8](../0008-interledger-quoting-protocol/0008-interledger-quoting-protocol.md).
This process is called remote quoting. Even though the first connector has a complete copy of all the liquidity curves, these curves might be out of date; they are used
to determine the best route, but not to determine which combination of source amount and destination amount the sender should use for a specific payment.
This situation is likely to change in the future.

Note that the points series ("liquidity curves") in route broadcasts, as well as the
amounts in quote requests and quote responses, are expressed in integer values in the ledger's base unit of the ledger. This means you will need to divide/multiply
by `10 ** currency_scale` for the ledger in question, to convert integers (in ledger units) to floats (in terms of the ledger's announced `currency_code`), and back.
