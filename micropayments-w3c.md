# Micropayment Use Cases

Notes from W3C Micropayments Breakout

## Use Cases
- Getting rid of paywalls
- Supporting creative works (tipping?)
- Badges for support
- Premium website experience
- Streaming service payments (electricity, AWS, B2B use cases)
- Ad-free content
- Paying for content curation
- Re-sharing content (getting paid for sharing good content)
- Micro work (like Mechanical Turk)
- IoT
- WebApp monetization
- Paid APIs

## Standard Requirements
1. How small is a micropayment? (Maybe any amount you would be happy to do automatically)
2. Transfer fees would need to be small enough
3. Need to prove why this time is different for micropayments at W3C - the right stakeholders werenâ€™t in the room, implementers all were working on their own projects and not interested in standardization
4. Privacy
